<h1><a name="top_page"></a>Better Access to Data</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />
Health Registries for Research (HRR) is a national project, sponsored by the Norwegian Research Council, sharing health research assets, and providing simplified access to the rich resources of the Norwegian public health sector and their world class health registries.   </p>
<p> Rich metadata with integrated sensitivty information provide better metadata and easier access to data.  Data harmonization and community outreach are combined to provide new opportunities for creating a secure infrastructure for transnational access to sensitive microdata.</p>
<p> A secure hybrid cloud is being developed in order to span the entire cost, performance, and confidentiality spectrum to enable new and innovate types of partnerships, and produce cutting-edge research and reliable policy evaluations.</p>
<h3>Cooperation across disciplines</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Applying novel knowledge from diverse disciplines in new contexts can can give you a leading advantage and a unique angle to solving outstanding problems in the field.</p>
<p>Providing opportunities for cooperation between complementary research groups will allow for new relationships and dialog between subject experts, for the purpose of combining collective expertise and producing synergies.  Beyond research and funding efficiency, the potential to get more output with less work,  the  chances for original (high-impact) research are increased.</p>
